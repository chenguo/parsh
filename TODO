Immediate:

File dependency hash:
     file.c: implementation
     dgraph.c: still necessary? Could we get away with a file tree hash of
               queued commands, and a frontier?
       maybe... file hash as a dependency lookup, for adding to the graph.
       Then the graph will be the actual dependency graph.

Long term:
Too many to list. But perhaps most difficult to do: write a good parser.
