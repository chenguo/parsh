Immediate:
1) Implement IF
* i)   Implement parent node feature - i.e. commands under IF have the IF command as parent.
  ii)  Keep count of how many commands are in condition part of IF.
* iii) Implement return value check.
* iv)  When child of IF condition returns true, insert THEN part into heap.
  v)   If all conditions have returned, and none were true, then insert ELSE
       part into heap.
2) Document basic workings
3) Free command sturcture after command finishes.

Long term:
Adapt code from modified Dash shell to Parsh. This includes things like IF,
WHILE/UNTIL, and FOR.
Too many small things to list... Mostly, be able to parse the subtle
intricacies of shell scripts and go from there.
