Immediate:
1) Implement IF
2) Document basic workings
3) Free command sturcture after command finishes.

Long term:
Adapt code from modified Dash shell to Parsh. This includes things like IF,
WHILE/UNTIL, and FOR.
Too many small things to list... Mostly, be able to parse the subtle
intricacies of shell scripts and go from there.
